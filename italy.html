    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I super love italian cuisine especially since there is so much uniqueness to their culture and food. It's not all just pasta and the accent. I also felt super inspired by Rosie Maio, an italian youtube content creator, who makes a vlog about her culture in italy and what they do there. I love her Nona's dishes the most because the way they prepare their food is not that complicated. </p>
