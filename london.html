    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in Manila and I have 2 siblings.<sup>1</sup> I'm the middle child in my family.<sup>2</sup> The oldest is a girl and the youngest is a boy.<sup>3</sup> My earliest memory from childhood was my grandmother passing away when I was around 3 or 4 years old.<sup>4</sup> I remember that day because it felt like I was suddenly brought into consciousness about all the things that were happening around me.<sup>5</sup> I felt empty once my grandmother left us and ever since then Iâ€™ve lived feeling slightly abandoned.<sup>6</sup> I don't remember her much but I know she was very important to me.<sup>7</sup> My mom would tell me stories when I got older about how my grandmother loved me so much that she wanted to keep me as her own when I was just a baby.<sup>8</sup> Maybe it was because my mom always told me how I was such an easy baby to take care of at that time.<sup>9</sup> She told me how as a baby I didn't cry a lot and I was easily soothed with anyone who would take care of me.<sup>10</sup> I guess I made people feel really excited when they see how I would respond to them.<sup>11</sup> When my grandmother died, I was with my mom and we just got home from the wet market near by our condo unit.<sup>12</sup> I really loved going with my mom to carry her grocery bags that's why I always wake up early when she goes to buy some food stock at home.<sup>13</sup> Then when we got home, I just felt confused with the atmosphere and then suddenly in the bedroom my grandfather was crying and he just hugged me and told me that grandma passed away.<sup>14</sup> I don't remember crying at that moment but when we were at the funeral I cried a lot.<sup>15</sup> Everyone felt a big loss because my grandma was always admired in the family.<sup>16</sup> My auntie, who was the youngest of my grandma and who is the closest relative to me, still misses her so much until now.<sup>17</sup> Experiencing someone's care like my grandmother, although is very vague in my memory, I believe has influenced me a lot.<sup>18</sup> That's cos her leaving made me very sensitive and learned to keep the people who will care for you.<sup>19</sup> I really wished I had remember her more instead of just knowing her through pictures.<sup>20</sup> </p>
