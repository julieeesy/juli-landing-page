            <p> Synopsis: After work the next day, Mr Gu is paid by his father and plucks up the courage to ask for her number. He hands it over without blinking, and he immediately messages Mi-Jeong. He tells her has money and asks her if she wants something to eat.

            Now while this is going on, we link back to the Liberation Club, where Mi-Jeong had earlier started leaving diary entries for herself, written with the title “My Liberation Notes.” Within this, it discusses parts of Mi-Jeong’s life and how she wants to start living differently to how she has before. Mi-Jeong doesn’t truly love anything.
