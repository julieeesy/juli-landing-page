        <blockquote>
          <p>My skills are cooking. I've cooked for a long time and I can still remember the first dish I cooked, which was cheese sticks. I learned how to cook mostly from my dad because he used to work as a chef in a Chinese restaurant. He would always make me cook for the whole family during lunch and dinner. Overtime, cooking has grown on me and I found how much I enjoy cooking for other people. I even started joining cooking competitions in schools and it was pretty fun. I was placed as head chef and our main course was spinach lasagna. My group mates were very cooperative and super helpful during the competition. We had to make 3 dishes: the appetizer, main course and dessert. In the end we won overall best for all dishes.
