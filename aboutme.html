    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark style="background-color:#F5F5DC;color:black;font-family:Verdana"> I was born in Manila and I have 2 siblings.<sup>1</sup> I'm the middle child in my family.<sup>2</sup> The oldest is a girl and the youngest is a boy.<sup>3</sup> My earliest memory from childhood was my grandmother passing away when I was around 3 or 4 years old.<sup>4</sup> I remember that day because it felt like I was suddenly brought into consciousness about all the things that were happening around me.<sup>5</sup> I felt empty once my grandmother left us and ever since then I’ve lived feeling slightly abandoned.<sup>6</sup> I don't remember her much but I know she was very important to me.<sup>7</sup> My mom would tell me stories when I got older about how my grandmother loved me so much that she wanted to keep me as her own when I was just a baby.<sup>8</sup> Maybe it was because my mom always told me how I was such an easy baby to take care of at that time.<sup>9</sup> She told me how as a baby I didn't cry a lot and I was easily soothed with anyone who would take care of me.<sup>10</sup> I guess I made people feel really excited when they see how I would respond to them.<sup>11</sup> When my grandmother died, I was with my mom and we just got home from the wet market near by our condo unit.<sup>12</sup> I really loved going with my mom to carry her grocery bags that's why I always wake up early when she goes to buy some food stock at home.<sup>13</sup> Then when we got home, I just felt confused with the atmosphere and then suddenly in the bedroom my grandfather was crying and he just hugged me and told me that grandma passed away.<sup>14</sup> I don't remember crying at that moment but when we were at the funeral I cried a lot.<sup>15</sup> Everyone felt a big loss because my grandma was always admired in the family.<sup>16</sup> My auntie, who was the youngest of my grandma and who is the closest relative to me, still misses her so much until now.<sup>17</sup> Experiencing someone's care like my grandmother, although is very vague in my memory, I believe has influenced me a lot.<sup>18</sup> That's cos her leaving made me very sensitive and learned to keep the people who will care for you.<sup>19</sup> I really wished I had remember her more instead of just knowing her through pictures.<sup>20</sup>

    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark style="background-color:#F5F5DC;color:black;font-family:Verdana"> My teenage years were a very rough patch.<sup>1</sup> During this time I was feeling really depressed and isolated because of how my parents would have conflicts with money.<sup>2</sup> That made me feel really insecure about myself that it made me lose the confidence to study properly in school.<sup>3</sup> It was really hard to make any friends cos I was too afraid to get hurt if I got close to anyone.<sup>4</sup> It's already really hard to deal with the problems at home so I didn't want to make my life more complicated with messy relationships.<sup>5</sup> At the time of my junior high I was attending Hope Christian High School.<sup>6</sup> It's a nice school but I couldn't fully enjoy it because of how afraid I was with everyone.<sup>7</sup> I made some really interesting friends there and are still my friends til this day.<sup>8</sup> Although to be honest we weren't the most healthiest frienship back then.<sup>9</sup> Now we have grown so much and we're glad that we stuck with each other through many difficulties.<sup>10</sup> When I had to change schools for my senior high though, I was very very depressed.<sup>11</sup> That's because I got bullied and was socially isolated from the whole batch.<sup>12</sup> I didn't really do anything wrong because I'm really quiet.<sup>13</sup> However, people made rumours about me saying that I was ratting the whole class to the office of student affairs everytime the whole class was cheating.<sup>14</sup> I never did those but they thought I did because I was in the girl scouts and I would pass by that office everytime I would go to the central office after school to bring down the Philppine flag after classes.<sup>15</sup> I felt miserable but I couldn't say anything back because no one would believe me.<sup>16</sup> So in the end I just had to bear it.<sup>17</sup> One of the bullies did apologize for what they did cause they wanted to know from me if it was true.<sup>17</sup> I explained to him what actually happened and he immediately tried to apologize and make the others stop.<sup>18</sup> Unfortunately they didn't and everday after school I just cried.<sup>19</sup> I used to cry so much that the corners of my eyes would bleed and when I wake up I couldn't open my eyes cause of the hardened tears.<sup>20</sup></mark></p>

    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark style="background-color:#F5F5DC;color:black;font-family:Verdana"> In my college years I attended UE for my first 2 school years.<sup>1</sup> I was honestly afraid that things would be the same as my experience in senior high.<sup>2</sup> and I had to brace myself again.<sup>3</sup> <q>I just had to go through this...</q> is what I thought to myself but fortunately enough I didnt have to go through all of that again.<sup>4</sup> My classmates here were less judgemental and now I’m excited to do stuff again.<sup>5</sup> I am very fortunate enough to study something exciting everyday despite it being very challenging at times.<sup>6</sup> I am always given support with everyone around me so I'm really happy at the moment.<sup>7</sup> As a batch we would go out together after school hours.<sup>8</sup> I'm really glad and so thankful for these precious memories.<sup>9</sup> Being with them has healed me so much inside from the past.<sup>10</sup> I'm grateful to them for giving my joy.<sup>11</sup> Unfortunately, I will have to move to another country after my 2nd year ends in UE.<sup>12</sup> That's why I try to make the most of everything with my classmates.<sup>13</sup> I want to make my mark and become close with everyone here.<sup>14</sup> This may be the last time I'll ever get to socialize with these kinds of group of people.<sup>15</sup> That's why I want to not be so shy and afraid of them.<sup>16</sup> And as much as possible document the moments I have with them so that I won't feel lonely when I migrate.<sup>17</sup> I don't know what will happen to me when I migrate but I just hope that I won't feel misrable like how I was in senior high again.<sup>18</sup> I hope that it won't be so scary and mentally challenging.<sup>19</sup> I hope I can do my best and study to the best I can.<sup>20</sup></mark></p>
