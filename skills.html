        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>My skills are cooking. I've cooked for a long time and I can still remember the first dish I cooked, which was cheese sticks. I learned how to cook mostly from my dad because he used to work as a chef in a Chinese restaurant. He would always make me cook for the whole family during lunch and dinner. Overtime, cooking has grown on me and I found how much I enjoy cooking for other people. I even started joining cooking competitions in schools and it was pretty fun. I was placed as head chef and our main course was spinach lasagna. My group mates were very cooperative and super helpful during the competition. We had to make 3 dishes: the appetizer, main course and dessert. In the end we won overall best for all dishes.

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  
          <blockquote>
        <p>My hobbies are photography and videography. I got into photography because I felt inspired by how calming it feels to take pictures. Plus learning about the intricacies of using a camera overall is really fun. There is no pressure to know how to use it immediately. It feels like anyone can like it immediately. It feels really nice when people ask me to take pictures for them. And what I like about it the most is when I get to take a look at all my captures. It feels like I can just enjoy it without the pressure of being perfectly good at it. At least it takes off my worries and helps me enjoy myself. I really enjoy it the most when I see all of my captures and I feel super content about it.

<h2>Interests</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>My interests are self improvement. I want to become better at myself, especially emotionally, physically and mentally. I want to become a better version of myself so that I can enjoy my life to the fullest. I want to be able to push myself to be better at things. And be okay with going out of my comfort zone. I know it can be painful at times but the long term benefits are worth it. I feel like I owe myself to learn to be happy even when things are bad. I want to take care of myself and become more mature. Even though I can be clumsy at times , I am determined. Even if it takes me a long time to improve. What matters to me is that I can grow each day.
