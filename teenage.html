    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark style="background-color:#F5F5DC;color:black;font-family:Verdana"> My teenage years were a very rough patch.<sup>1</sup> During this time I was feeling really depressed and isolated because of how my parents would have conflicts with money.<sup>2</sup> That made me feel really insecure about myself that it made me lose the confidence to study properly in school.<sup>3</sup> It was really hard to make any friends cos I was too afraid to get hurt if I got close to anyone.<sup>4</sup> It's already really hard to deal with the problems at home so I didn't want to make my life more complicated with messy relationships.<sup>5</sup> At the time of my junior high I was attending Hope Christian High School.<sup>6</sup> It's a nice school but I couldn't fully enjoy it because of how afraid I was with everyone.<sup>7</sup> I made some really interesting friends there and are still my friends til this day.<sup>8</sup> Although to be honest we weren't the most healthiest frienship back then.<sup>9</sup> Now we have grown so much and we're glad that we stuck with each other through many difficulties.<sup>10</sup> When I had to change schools for my senior high though, I was very very depressed.<sup>11</sup> That's because I got bullied and was socially isolated from the whole batch.<sup>12</sup> I didn't really do anything wrong because I'm really quiet.<sup>13</sup> However, people made rumours about me saying that I was ratting the whole class to the office of student affairs everytime the whole class was cheating.<sup>14</sup> I never did those but they thought I did because I was in the girl scouts and I would pass by that office everytime I would go to the central office after school to bring down the Philppine flag after classes.<sup>15</sup> I felt miserable but I couldn't say anything back because no one would believe me.<sup>16</sup> So in the end I just had to bear it.<sup>17</sup> One of the bullies did apologize for what they did cause they wanted to know from me if it was true.<sup>17</sup> I explained to him what actually happened and he immediately tried to apologize and make the others stop.<sup>18</sup> Unfortunately they didn't and everday after school I just cried.<sup>19</sup> I used to cry so much that the corners of my eyes would bleed and when I wake up I couldn't open my eyes cause of the hardened tears.<sup>20</sup></mark></p>
