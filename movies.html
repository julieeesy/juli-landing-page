            <p>Synopsis: While writing other people’s emotions, she may have neglected her own. Violet Evergarden, the child soldier turned Auto Memory Doll, writes letters that evoke the words her clients can’t. But when a terminally ill boy requests her services for her family, her own feelings about love and loss resurface. Now she must confront her past and the death of the Major.

            <p>Synopsis: Kiki's sadness takes a tangible toll on her, and robs her of her magical powers. By the end of the movie, Kiki still hasn’t entirely recovered from these feelings — while she’s able to fly on her broomstick once more, she loses the bond she has with her familiar Jiji. She’s never able to recover that relationship in the same way, but the new gap between them speaks to the idea of accepting loneliness as part of growing up.
