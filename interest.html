    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <blockquote>

    <p>My interests are self improvement. I want to become better at myself, especially emotionally, physically and mentally. I want to become a better version of myself so that I can enjoy my life to the fullest. I want to be able to push myself to be better at things. And be okay with going out of my comfort zone. I know it can be painful at times but the long term benefits are worth it. I feel like I owe myself to learn to be happy even when things are bad. I want to take care of myself and become more mature. Even though I can be clumsy at times , I am determined. Even if it takes me a long time to improve. What matters to me is that I can grow each day.
    </p>
