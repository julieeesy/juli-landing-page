	<h3>COLLEGE YEARS</h3>
	<hr>
    <div>
    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my college years I attended UE for my first 2 school years.<sup>1</sup> I was honestly afraid that things would be the same as my experience in senior high.<sup>2</sup> and I had to brace myself again.<sup>3</sup> <q>I just had to go through this...</q> is what I thought to myself but fortunately enough I didnt have to go through all of that again.<sup>4</sup> My classmates here were less judgemental and now Iâ€™m excited to do stuff again.<sup>5</sup> I am very fortunate enough to study something exciting everyday despite it being very challenging at times.<sup>6</sup> I am always given support with everyone around me so I'm really happy at the moment.<sup>7</sup> As a batch we would go out together after school hours.<sup>8</sup> I'm really glad and so thankful for these precious memories.<sup>9</sup> Being with them has healed me so much inside from the past.<sup>10</sup> I'm grateful to them for giving my joy.<sup>11</sup> Unfortunately, I will have to move to another country after my 2nd year ends in UE.<sup>12</sup> That's why I try to make the most of everything with my classmates.<sup>13</sup> I want to make my mark and become close with everyone here.<sup>14</sup> This may be the last time I'll ever get to socialize with these kinds of group of people.<sup>15</sup> That's why I want to not be so shy and afraid of them.<sup>16</sup> And as much as possible document the moments I have with them so that I won't feel lonely when I migrate.<sup>17</sup> I don't know what will happen to me when I migrate but I just hope that I won't feel misrable like how I was in senior high again.<sup>18</sup> I hope that it won't be so scary and mentally challenging.<sup>19</sup> I hope I can do my best and study to the best I can.<sup>20</sup></mark></p>
